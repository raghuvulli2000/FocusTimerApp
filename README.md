## Overview
### Description
So if you’re wondering about the name of our app, Loco Foco. Loco means crazy in Spanish and by combining it with “Foco” which is our shortened version for “Focus”, the app name roughly translates to “Crazy Focus”. We thought it would be a fun name to go with our productivity app. Also fun fact our cat mascot is named “Loco”. The main function of Loco Foco is for the user to set up timers for their study/work periods. What sets Loco Foco apart from other timer apps is that users are motivated to finish their task by being able to collect THE MOST ADORABLE, HEART MELTING cat pictures. With timer functionality and an encaptivating collection of cat images, LocoFoco is the perfect balance of productivity and heartwarming engagement.
